<p>
	Building the right website for your business is a lot more than making it pretty. I have seen clients spend hundreds of dollars on a site and I've seen clients spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on a website. The first question to ask is what you want your site to do for you, and what is your budget. A website is an investment and if you don't see the right return on your investment, it's not the right website for you.

<h1 id="coaching">Business Coaching</h1>

<p>
	One of the hardest parts of running a business can be collecting your thoughts and building a plan to success. Our managment team has experience sitting down with business leaders in a wide range of disciplines and guiding them to find places where their business can grow or approaches that are not currently working. Our coaches don't know what is best for your business, but we have the skills to help you look at things differently and see where you need to go.

	Many companies start out keeping track of cutomers, transactions, and inventory on spreadsheets. While this quick solution can be a good solution at the time, it is critical to know when it's time to move to more robust systems.
